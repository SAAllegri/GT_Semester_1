Name: Stephen Allegri & Zhiwei Zheng
GTID: 903207717

OS: Windows 10 / Mac OS (Zhiwei)
Compiler: MiniGW
IDE: CLion / VScode (Zhiwei)

How I run my program (using CLion):

1. Install MiniGW @ http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds --> If this doesn't work, there are other open source versions and instructions online (at the official
CLion support site). 

2. create a new project --> settings --> Build, Execution, Deployment --> Toolchains --> MiniGW (find path and select- it should automaticall configure)

3. Copy and paste my files into new project. Some filenames might need to be renamed to work (right click main.c, or a different file, to find the refactor --> rename option).

*Note: Our codes work for both IDEs and OSs
